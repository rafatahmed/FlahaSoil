## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**

   - Password hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
   - User created with `emailVerified: false`
   - Welcome and verification emails sent automatically
   - JWT token generated for immediate access

2. **Email Verification**

   - Secure verification token generated (24h expiration)
   - Email sent with verification link
   - Verification page validates token and updates user status
   - Profile displays verification status with resend option

3. **Password Reset**

   - Reset token generated (1h expiration)
   - Password reset email sent with secure link
   - Reset page validates token and allows password update
   - New password hashed and stored securely

4. **Login Security**
   - Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
   - JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
   - Secure password comparison with bcrypt
   - User data returned includes verification status

### Security Measures

- **Rate Limiting**: Different limits for auth, password reset, and email verification
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS prevention and data validation
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- **Token Security**: Separate tokens for different purposes with appropriate expiration
- **Email Security**: Secure token generation and validation

### Email Integration

- **Development**: Ethereal email service with preview URLs in console
- **Production**: SendGrid integration ready with environment variables
- **Templates**: HTML email templates with professional styling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful email failure handling without breaking user flows

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"  # SQLite for development

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:8080"  # or your production domain

# Email Configuration
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@flahasoil.com"

# Production Email (SendGrid example)
NODE_ENV="production"
SENDGRID_USERNAME="your-sendgrid-username"
SENDGRID_PASSWORD="your-sendgrid-password"
```

### Installation Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd api-implementation
npm install

# Database setup
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Start frontend server
cd ../public
python -m http.server 8080
```
