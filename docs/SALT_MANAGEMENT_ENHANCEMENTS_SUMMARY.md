## 🎯 **1. Units Consistency**

### **BEFORE:**
```
Leaching Depth: 7.8 mm
Total Water Need: 32.8 mm
```

### **AFTER:**
```
Leaching Depth: {
    value: 7.8,
    unit: 'mm',
    basis: 'per irrigation event',
    description: 'Additional water depth required for salt leaching'
}
Total Water Need: {
    value: 32.8,
    unit: 'mm', 
    basis: 'per irrigation event',
    description: 'Total water requirement (irrigation + leaching)'
}
```

**✅ Improvement:** Clear time basis and descriptive context for all measurements.

---

## 💰 **2. Economic Benefit Transparency**

### **BEFORE:**
```
Economic Benefit: $730
Payback Period: 3.2 years
Benefit/Cost Ratio: 2.1
```

### **AFTER:**
```
Economic Analysis: {
    extraWaterCost: $20 ($/ha/season),
    potentialSaltDamage: $750 ($/ha/year),
    netBenefit: $730 ($/ha/season),
    benefitCostRatio: 38.2 (seasonal average - 4-month growing period),
    analysisNote: 'Based on GCC water costs and regional crop values'
}
Payback Period: {
    value: 3.2,
    unit: 'years',
    basis: 'seasonal crop cycles'
}
```

**✅ Improvement:** Complete transparency on time basis, cost assumptions, and calculation methodology.

---

## 🏷️ **3. Scenario Naming Improvements**

### **BEFORE:**
```
"Extreme Salinity Date Palm"
```

### **AFTER:**
```
"Extreme Salinity Date Palm (Perennial Tree)"
Description: "Highly salt-tolerant perennial under extreme conditions"
```

**✅ Improvement:** Clear crop categorization and descriptive context for each test scenario.

---

## 🧂 **4. Salt Inputs/Outputs Quality Flags**

### **NEW FEATURE:**
```
INPUT QUALITY FLAGS:
• [WARNING] Fertilizer salts contributing >25% of total salt input
  Recommendation: Consider reducing fertilizer application or switching to low-salt alternatives

OUTPUT QUALITY FLAGS:
• [CAUTION] Crop uptake unusually low - verify crop growth stage
  Recommendation: Monitor crop health and adjust uptake estimates based on growth stage
```

**✅ Improvement:** Automatic detection and flagging of unusual conditions with specific recommendations.

---

## 📋 **5. Enhanced Recommendations with Sample Actions**

### **BEFORE:**
```
Recommendations: 2 items
- Implement intensive leaching program
- Optimize leaching timing
```

### **AFTER:**
```
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. [HIGH] Implement intensive leaching program
   Details: Apply 31% extra water every irrigation
   Sample Action: "Increase leaching fraction to 0.35 if EC rises above 2.2 dS/m"
   Expected Outcome: Reduce soil salinity by 15-25% within 2-3 irrigation cycles
   Timing: immediate

2. [HIGH] Optimize leaching timing for summer conditions
   Details: Apply leaching water during early morning (4-6 AM) to minimize evaporation
   Sample Action: "Schedule leaching irrigations between 4-6 AM when evaporation rate is <6 mm/day"
   Expected Outcome: Reduce water loss by 20-30% compared to midday application
   Timing: daily
```

**✅ Improvement:** Specific, actionable guidance with concrete examples and expected outcomes.

---

## 🔍 **6. Complete Traceability**

### **NEW FEATURE:**
```
TRACEABILITY:
• Test Run ID: TR-1748970894937-2ghhr98e6
• Calculation ID: LR-1748970894938-3gr3w8xdl
• Session ID: SS-1748970894938-pnembh1ug
• Input Hash: a576fe5a
• Confidence Level: high
• Timestamp: 2025-06-03T17:14:54.937Z
```

**✅ Improvement:** Full audit trail with unique identifiers for debugging and quality assurance.

---

## 📊 **7. Enhanced Data Interpretation**

### **NEW FEATURE:**
```
Net Balance: {
    value: 138.3,
    unit: 'kg/ha',
    timeframe: 'monthly',
    interpretation: 'Critical salt accumulation - immediate intervention needed'
}
```

**✅ Improvement:** Contextual interpretation of numerical results for better decision-making.
