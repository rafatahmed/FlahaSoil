## ✅ Key Improvements

1. Enhanced package.json:

Added proper project metadata
Added useful npm scripts (start, dev, backend, test)
Added keywords and repository information 2. Consolidated Documentation:

Single API.md with comprehensive API documentation
CHANGELOG.md for tracking project changes
Updated README.md with current project structure 3. Clean Asset Organization:

Renamed soil_water_calculations_new.js → soilCalculations.js
Updated all references to use new filename
Removed duplicate and unused files 4. Proper Test Organization:

Created dedicated tests/ directory
Moved test files out of root directory
✅ Files Count Reduction
Before Cleanup: ~80+ files in root and scattered locations
After Cleanup: ~15 core files in root + organized subdirectories

Removed: 40+ redundant/duplicate/test files
Organized: Remaining files into logical directory structure

✅ Next Steps
The project is now clean and well-organized. You can:

Start Development:
npm start # Start frontend
npm run backend # Start backend API
npm run dev # Development mode

Run Tests:
npm test # Run test suite

Deploy:
Frontend: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
Backend: Node.js hosting (Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)
The project now has a clean, professional structure that's easy to navigate, maintain, and deploy. The API is properly documented, and all redundant files have been removed while preserving all core functionality.
